# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The URL shortener application currently has several critical issues that prevent it from functioning properly. The main problems include CORS configuration issues, API endpoint connectivity problems, error handling inconsistencies, and potential frontend-backend communication failures. This specification addresses fixing these core functionality issues to ensure the application works as intended.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the URL shortening functionality to work reliably so that I can successfully create short URLs without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid URL THEN the system SHALL successfully create a shortened URL without CORS errors
2. WHEN the backend receives a shorten request THEN it SHALL respond with proper CORS headers to allow frontend access
3. WHEN there is a network error THEN the system SHALL display a clear, user-friendly error message
4. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to access shortened URLs so that they redirect me to the original destination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a shortened URL THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the original URL
2. WHEN a shortened URL has expired THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate expiration message
3. WHEN a shortened URL doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error message
4. WHEN there are server errors during redirection THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging so that I can debug issues and monitor application health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log it with appropriate detail level
2. WHEN the logging service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to console logging without breaking functionality
3. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL validate and return specific error messages
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL initialize all services properly and report any configuration issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a consistent and reliable user interface so that I can interact with it without encountering JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN all UI components SHALL render correctly without console errors
2. WHEN a user interacts with form elements THEN they SHALL respond appropriately with visual feedback
3. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN all styling SHALL be consistent and readable
4. WHEN using the application on mobile devices THEN the responsive design SHALL work properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper validation and feedback so that I understand what went wrong when my request fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an invalid URL THEN the system SHALL provide specific validation feedback
2. WHEN a custom shortcode is already taken THEN the system SHALL inform the user clearly
3. WHEN the validity period is invalid THEN the system SHALL explain the acceptable range
4. WHEN the server returns an error THEN the frontend SHALL display the server's error message appropriately
